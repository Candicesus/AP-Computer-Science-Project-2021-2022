//This is the research file for the butterbot from Rick and Morty. Since in this project I will be building a robot a lot of desiging is going to have to be made beforehand.
I will need the hardware for the robot and software for the robot. I'll firstly start of with the desigining of the robot and then get the hardware needeed for the robot. 
I have instead decided in building a robot dog, or otherwise a quadruplet robot based off of python.
